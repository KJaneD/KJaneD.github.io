## Past Projects

As an undergraduate student I contributed to the [Global Water Pathogens Project](https://www.waterpathogens.org/) by conducting a systematic literature review to identify persistence datasets for various targets in wastewater-related matrices. A suite of persistence models were fit to these datasets to attempt to identify the model forms best able to describe the persistence behaviors of the different pathogen types. This work highlighted the importance of using pathogen specific persistence data and further suggested that pathogen persistence in the environment may be more dynamic than the commonly applied first-order decay model. This was also my first experience working in R and dealing with large datasets.

During this time I also worked with members of our lab to add new datasets to the QMRA Wiki. The Wiki is a community portal for sharing data relevant to QMRAs, completed case studies, and educational materials. Through this process I became more familiar with the foundations of dose response modeling within QMRAs, and began fitting dose response models to new data for pathogens relevant to various water matrices.

My master's research was funded by the EPA Grant "Right Sizing Tomorrow's Water Systems for Efficiency, Sustainability, and Public Health" (**#R836890**). The goal of this project was to better understand and predict water quality within premise plumbing systems. Under this project, I fit novel dose response models for three opportunistic pathogens and conducted a reverse QMRA for *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* hand washing, face washing, and showering exposure events. My work was one component of a multi-objective and interdisciplinary effort that included researchers from Purdue University, Michigan State University, Tulane University, San Jose State University, Manhattan College and the University of Memphis.

## Current Work

I am a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow working on finishing my dissertation. My research is focused on improving our understanding of pathogen persistnece in surface waters to better inform decision makers in the fields of water treatment and management. Pathogens can be introduced to surface waters via a variety of sources of pollution, and surface waters are used for recreation, irrigation, and as source water for drinking water treatment plants. Understanding how long the pathogens persist in the different surface water environments is an important component of characterizing any possible human health risks associated with using the water.
