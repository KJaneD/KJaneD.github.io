# Welcome!

I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering [(BAE)](https://www.egr.msu.edu/bae/) at Michigan State University. I have been a part of the [Mitchell lab](http://www.jmitchellphd.com/) for the past six years, and my research interests include quantitative microbial risk assessment, persistence, and dose response modeling. 

Check out my [CV](./CV_rmd_KD.html).

## Research Projects
I have had the opportunity to contribute to a number of projects during my time at Michigan State. These efforts have culminated in 10 peer-reviewed publications and more than 15 local and national presentations. For more details, check out my [Research Projects](./research_projects.html).

## What is QMRA?
The QMRA framework uses mathematical modeling to characterize the risk associated with microbial contaminants in environmental matrices. The [QMRA Wiki](http://qmrawiki.org/) is a great resource to learn about the different components of a QMRA, to access peer-reviewed dose response models, and to explore different case studies. I attended the QMRA Institute in 2018 and have continued to apply that knowledge to better understand pathogen-related risks in surface and drinking waters. The next institute is planned for this upcoming July- [QMRA IV](https://events.anr.msu.edu/QMRAIV2022/).
