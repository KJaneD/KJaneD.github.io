# Welcome!

I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering [(BAE)](https://www.egr.msu.edu/bae/) at Michigan State University. I have been a part of the [Mitchell lab](http://www.jmitchellphd.com/) for the past six years, and my research interests include quantitative microbial risk assessment, persistence, and dose response modeling.
