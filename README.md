# Welcome!

I graduated with my PhD in December 2022 from the Department of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering [(BAE)](https://www.egr.msu.edu/bae/) at Michigan State University. I have been a part of the [Mitchell lab](http://www.jmitchellphd.com/) for the past six years, and my research interests include quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), persistence, and dose response modeling. 

Check out my [CV](./CV_rmd_KD.html) to see my background and accomplishments in academia. 

## Research Projects
I have had the opportunity to contribute to a number of projects during my time at Michigan State. These efforts have culminated in 12 peer-reviewed publications and more than 15 local and national presentations. For more details, check out my [Research Projects](./research_projects.html).

## What is QMRA?
The QMRA framework uses mathematical modeling to characterize the risk associated with microbial contaminants in environmental matrices. The [QMRA Wiki](http://qmrawiki.org/) is a great resource to learn about the different components of a QMRA, to access peer-reviewed dose response models, and to explore different case studies. I attended the QMRA Institute in 2018 and have continued to apply that knowledge to better understand pathogen-related risks in surface and drinking waters. The next institute is planned for this upcoming July- [QMRA IV](https://events.anr.msu.edu/QMRAIV2022/).

## More About Me...
Outside of academia, I'm an avid backpacker and hiker. I live in Michigan so my more frequent destinations are the Upper Peninsula and Canada, but I've also enjoyed exploring parts of Maine, Colorado, and Montana in the past five years. Spending time in nature helps inspire me to find ways to leverage risk assessment, exposure science, and engineering methods to protect the planet and move towards a more sustainable future.
