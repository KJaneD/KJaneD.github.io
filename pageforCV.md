**RESEARCH EXPERIENCE**

National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow                 Sep 2019-Present
  •	Pursue PhD studies with the goal of elucidating factors involved in the fate and 
    transport of microbial hazards in surface and drinking water to ultimately predict 
    human health risk
MS Graduate Research Assistant                                      Sep 2017-Aug 2019
  •	Right Sizing Tomorrow’s Water Systems for Efficiency, Sustainability, and Public
    Health: Responsible for integrating the chemical and microbial analyses of water 
    sampling efforts to determine risks associated with opportunistic pathogens in 
    drinking water systems.
Undergraduate Researcher
  •	Center for Advancing Microbial Risk Assessment (CAMRA): Used previous peer-
    reviewed dose response studies to produce dose response models to be used in 
    future quantitative microbial risk assessments. 
  •	Citizen Science Study of Contaminant Exposures Related to Water Affordability in 
    Detroit: Aided in the experimental design and interaction with the community to 
    gather and interpret water sampling results.
  •	Global Water Pathogens Project: Performed a literature review to identify and 
    analyze the persistence of microorganisms in different matrices (freshwater, 
    seawater, wastewater, etc.) and fit novel persistence models using R Statistical 
    Programming Language.
  •	MSU Extension: Helped conduct an energy efficiency case study on Grand Valley 
    Farm’s implementation of solar heating panels, LED lighting, and center-pivot 
    irrigation systems
